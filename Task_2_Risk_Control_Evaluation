# 📌 Task 2: Risk Control Evaluation – Revenue Control #4005

## ✉️ Email to Senior Accountant – Risk Control Findings

Hi Alex,

I have begun testing Evergreen’s revenue internal controls and would like to update you on some of my concerns.

I have been reviewing Control #4005, which addresses two risks:  
1. Big orders being processed but not paid due to customers with poor credit history.  
2. Orders processed when inventory is not in stock at the quantity ordered.

Evergreen’s current control is a good start but only addresses **new customers**. We should consider a control to review **existing customers with poor payment history**.

Additionally, the current inventory check process appears **manual and reactive**. I recommend suggesting Evergreen enhance their sales portal to **automatically restrict orders exceeding current inventory**, reducing customer frustration and operational errors.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.

Sincerely,  
Audit Team
