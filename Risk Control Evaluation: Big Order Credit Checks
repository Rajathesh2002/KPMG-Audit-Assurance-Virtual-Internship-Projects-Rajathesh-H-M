Hi Alex,

Iâ€™ve started reviewing Evergreenâ€™s revenue internal controls and wanted to share my initial observations regarding Control #4005 â€“ *Big Order Credit Checks*.

This control aims to address two key risks:
1. Large sales being processed for customers with poor creditworthiness.
2. Sales being confirmed without sufficient inventory in stock.

While the control is a good start and applies to new customers placing orders of $100,000 or more, there are a few concerns:

- It doesnâ€™t address **existing customers with poor payment history**. A customer with past due balances could still place large orders without re-evaluation.
- Only **one out of three credit references** is contacted, which may limit the depth of review.
- The **inventory validation step is reactive and manual**, potentially frustrating customers if orders are adjusted or canceled after submission.
- There is **no indication of how overrides are tracked** if someone bypasses this process.

### âœ… Recommendations:
- Implement a process for reviewing **existing customer payment history** for large orders.
- Automate order system to prevent customers from ordering more SKUs than available inventory.
- Add documentation or system logging for **manual overrides** and **credit review steps**.
- Ensure all reference checks are logged and not skipped.

Let me know if youâ€™d like to discuss this further â€” happy to connect.

Best regards,
